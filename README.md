## Introduction
This is a fully textured, voxel map generator that does multi-threaded voxel meshing. It creates fixed-size worlds. The meshing technique used is full greedy algorithm. Currently, the project does not include collider functionality.

I developed this project as a hobby and found it to be a valuable learning experience as I had to overcome various challenges. I am now sharing the code with the community for anyone to use and modify as they see fit.

## ðŸ•’ Unity Version
This project has been tested on Unity 2021.3.11f1 and may work on other versions with some minor adjustments, as the majority of the code is generic C#.

## ðŸ“¦ Installation
To use this project in your own Unity project, simply follow these steps:

- Clone the repository or download the zip file.
- Add the subfolders to the Assets folder of your Unity project.
- You're ready to go! Enjoy generating your own voxel worlds.
